# Preact Redux Bundler PWA Kit

This is the base scaffold I use when building progressive web applications with preact. It is built from the default template from the preact-cli with some additional features I've added. I prefer using redux-bundler for state, and use `styled-system` + `emotion` for all of the styling.

## CLI Commands

``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
yarn dev

# build for production with minification
yarn build

# test the production build locally
yarn start
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [CLI Readme](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli/blob/master/README.md).
